# We use boolean array indexing to construct a rank 1 array
# consisting of the elements of a corresponding to the True values
# of bool_idx
print(a[bool_idx])  # Prints "[3 4 5 6]"

# We can do all of the above in a single concise statement:
# 以 boolean 类型作为下标索引，显示下标中为Ture的所有元素值
print(a[a > 2])     # Prints "[3 4 5 6]"

# [[ 5  6  7]
#  [ 9 10 11]]

#  [ 8 10 12]]
