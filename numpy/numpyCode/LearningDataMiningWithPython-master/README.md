# LearningDataMiningWithPython

Updated code for the Learning Data Mining With Python book.

Libraries change, bugs get found, and things could use a little more explaining.
That's the role of this repository, to act as an addition to the book "Learning Data Mining with Python", written by Robert Layton.
This git repository will be updated with improved code and instuctions, designed to further the lessons learnt in the book.

## Scope of this Repo
At this stage, we won't be going past the scope of the book.
Feel free to add a feature request, and I'll try fulfil it somehow, somewhere.

I also have a site [LearningTensorFlow.com](http://learningtensorflow.com/) if you want to learn about Google's TensorFlow algorithm.
I also **also** have the [dataPipeline](https://datapipeline.com.au/) website, which contains a blog that talks about all things data analysis and projects.

## In Detail
The next step in the information age is to gain insights from the deluge of data coming our way. Data mining provides a way of finding this insight, and Python is one of the most popular languages for data mining, providing both power and flexibility in analysis.

This book teaches you to design and develop data mining applications using a variety of datasets, starting with basic classification and affinity analysis. Next, we move on to more complex data types including text, images, and graphs. In every chapter, we create models that solve real-world problems.

There is a rich and varied set of libraries available in Python for data mining. This book covers a large number, including the IPython Notebook, pandas, scikit-learn and NLTK.

Each chapter of this book introduces you to new algorithms and techniques. By the end of the book, you will gain a large insight into using Python for data mining, with a good knowledge and understanding of the algorithms and implementations.
