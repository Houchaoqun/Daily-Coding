1. tensorflow: 
export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.1.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
# Python 2
$ pip install $TF_BINARY_URL

# Python 3
$ pip3 install $TF_BINARY_URL

note: you should make sure whether you need to add the [sudo] before pip or not.
there are two vision of pip including anaconda2 and original vision.
== if you add sudo, maybe it's the original vision
== but you need anaconda2 here.

2. tflearn:
For the bleeding edge version:
pip install git+https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn.git

For the latest stable version:
pip install tflearn

You can also install from source by running this command (from source folder):
python setup.py install

== I choose [pip install tflearn] here.
